The Robotics has been driven by the possibilities of using robots to assist human beings. The design of a humanoid robotic system aims to obtain a machine adapted to the human environment and that can perform tasks to assist people with greater adaptability and ease of execution. This work presents the humanoid robot Adam, which will have an open architecture platform, both for simulations and for its physical model. The prototype will be used as an object of tests and thus promote advances in the most diverse techniques of robotics and artificial intelligence. The robotic platform will be developed using the ROS (Robot Operating System), which is a collection of software frameworks for robot development, which provides the functionality of an operating system in a heterogeneous computer cluster.
